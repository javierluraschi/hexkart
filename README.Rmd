## Getting Started

Clone this GitHub repo and open the package project in RStudio, then launch this 
simulation as follows, you can turn left and right using your arroy keys:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(kartsim)
kartsim_play()
```

![](tools/README/kart-demo.gif)

To capture a kart session simply run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
kartsim_capture()
```

This will create a snapshot under `capture/` with labels: `###-left.png`,
`###-forward.png` or `###-right.png` that you can use for training. Once trained,
you can use `kartsim_control()` to feed predictions back. We can feed a random
direction by running:

```{r eval=F}
labels <- c("left", "forward", "right")
kartsim::kartsim_control(function(image, direction) {
  sample(labels, 1)
})
```
